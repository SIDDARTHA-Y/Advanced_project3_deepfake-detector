# Deepfake Detection System

This project detects deepfake images/videos using AI.

## Features
- Uses deep learning (CNN) to classify real vs. fake images.
- Supports video analysis for frame-by-frame detection.
- Provides a web interface for easy uploads and predictions.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train model: `python train.py`
3. Run detector: `python detect.py`

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with GAN-based detection.
